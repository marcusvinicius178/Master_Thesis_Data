The extraction from the bridge data, between LGSVL simulator and ROS topics, were done using the ROSBAG useful commands!
Two approaches were used:

1 - Extract Data directly from the recorded .bag data

The commands to do this are outline in the "ROSBAG_Commands"
The most applied commands to tranfer specific topic data to a .csv or .txt file are written in topic number 7 of this document.


2 - Extract data from the rosbag using Python code, from an IDLE ( I used Spyder):
This approach was better to also threat the data, process data, or do a Data Science of this data (as it is preferred)

A) The data from specific topics, such as odometry, were extracted and stored in a list. 
B)Then this data is processed in this code. For example I needed to convert the ROS Orientation data that comes in quaternion to roll, pitch and yaw, in order to get the vehicle heading angle, while it was following the trajectory.
C) Finally these processed lists are converted to DATAFRAMES, which is a better format to import and plot the data in a further process codes...

This approach codes are available and begin with prefix "2_A", "2_B"...I have used numerous auxiliar codes such as this to process ROS data...and I making some of them available in this folder...


3- Some of The RAW extracted data, csv files from ROSBAG topics, USED to plot the trip data are available at the folder "CSV_extracted_DATA".
