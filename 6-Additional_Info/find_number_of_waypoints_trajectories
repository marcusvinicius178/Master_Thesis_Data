Get the number of waypoints for each planner:

In code "Op_Plot_Deviation_xyz_with_CLASSES.py


#ASTAR

Astar_df_pose_orientation_final_wp['field.waypoints107.wpstate.aid']

If above condition returns true or false until find the number of waypoints
in case of AStar there is 107 points to create the trajectory

FREESPACE_ASTAR = 107 WAYPOINTS

#OPEN PLANNER
Op_df_pose_orientation_final_wp['field.waypoints192.wpstate.aid']
OPEN_PLANNER = 192 WAYPOINTS

#LATTICE
Lattice_calculate_waypoints['field.waypoints106.wpstate.aid']

FREESPACE_LATTICE = 106 WAYPOINTS


#APOLLO

UNTIL THE ROW 261 IS GIVEN DATA FOR X,Y PATH
THE DATA BEGIN TO FLOW IN ROW 53
THEREFORE APOLLO GENERATES 261-53 = 208 WAYPOINTS

FOR THIS REASON IT IS THE SMOOTHER BECAUSE CALCULATE MORE WAYPOINTS
