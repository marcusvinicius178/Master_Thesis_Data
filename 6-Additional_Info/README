This folder contain just additional data, or I would say, Conclusions that I was having and taking notes while plotting data, or writing the master thesis...It is not synchronized or in a cronological order...almost all the notes are in portuguese (cause I am brazilian).
But a translator can help you understand. I would highlight the following data:

A - Potência_Calculo - In this file I have summarized the main steps to calculate how much Power (Hp) each trajectory planner consumes. The power consequently will influence in the fuel consumption...

B - Tópicos_BAG_plotar_ou_nao: I have summarized the meaning of each Autoware topic, and highlighted the ones that makes sense to extract and plot

C - ROSGRAPH Planners Interpretation + RORSBAG_Planner.jpeg = These files describe and show respectivelly how the trajectory planner generates the path, for each Autoware planner.

There are other files here too, that if you wish to know the meaning of just send me an e-mail:
