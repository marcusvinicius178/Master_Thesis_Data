There is a README file available in each folder contained in this "Master_Thesis_Data" Folder.

If you would like to have some data to try, or to improve one of my codes, or just play with it. 
If you wish to visualize the simulation videos or my master thesis presentation. 
Or if you wish any other data of information from this thesis, just send me an email asking for it!

I will be happy in answering!
